This “Greeting Kata” project is designed to implement a flexible greeting function that handles various input cases and is thoroughly tested using JUnit. The GreetingTest.java file contains test cases for different greeting scenarios, such as greeting one person, no one, shouting a greeting, handling two names, and handling multiple names with special rules for shouting and parsing complex strings (like names with commas). The Person.java file contains the greet method, which processes input strings (names) and generates the correct greeting. It handles different conditions like multiple names, names with uppercase letters (for shouting), and commas in names. The project emphasizes test-driven development (TDD), ensuring that the greet method covers edge cases and special formats.
